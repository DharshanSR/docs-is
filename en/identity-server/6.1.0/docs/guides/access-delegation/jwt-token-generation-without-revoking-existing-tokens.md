# JWT (JSON Web Token) token generation without revoking existing tokens

!!! note
    Instead of configuring the **JWT** token in the
    `deployment.toml` file, you can also choose to configure
    it using the management console while configuring the OAuth application.

    Select **JWT** as the Token Issuer for a new or existing OAuth/OpenID
    connect consumer application.Â See
    [Advanced OpenID Connect Configurations](../../../guides/login/oauth-app-config-advanced/)
    for more information.

When WSO2 Identity Server receives a request to generate a new JSON Web Token (JWT), it issues a token based on the **application, user, scope, and binding** combination. If the server receives another request for the same combination, it revokes the existing token and returns a new one.


If you want to generate a JWT token without revoking the existing token,
add and configure the following property in the `deployment.toml` file found in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` folder.

```toml
[oauth.jwt.renew_token_without_revoking_existing]
enable = true
```

!!! Note
    This feature is available for token request with the `client_crendetials` grant type by default. If you need to enable for
    other grant types, add the following configuration to `deployment.toml` file.

    ```toml
    [oauth.jwt.renew_token_without_revoking_existing]
    enable = true
    allowed_grant_types = ["client_credentials","password", ...]
    ```

!!! Warning
    Enabling this feature could lead to an exponential growth of tokens.
    Be sure to configure token clean up scripts with proper time limits.
    See [Remove Unused Tokens from the Database](../../../deploy/remove-unused-tokens-from-the-database/) for details.
