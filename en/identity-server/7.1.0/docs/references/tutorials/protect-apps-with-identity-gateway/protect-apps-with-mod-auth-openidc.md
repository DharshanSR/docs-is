# Integrate mod_auth_openidc with WSO2 Identity Server

[mod_auth_openidc](https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc){: target="_blank"} is an Apache HTTP Server module that provides OpenID Connect authentication. It acts as a reverse proxy that authenticates users via an external OIDC provider (like WSO2 Identity Server) and forwards identity information to your back-end app via HTTP headers. This guide explains how you can connect {{product_name}} with mod_auth_openidc.

## Prerequisites

- A package manager (for example apt, yum, Homebrew) to install Apache HTTPD.

- An application with a back-end. If you don't have one, you can use this [sample application](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/raw/refs/heads/master/identity-gateway/sample-request-logger-app/request-logger.jar){: target="_blank"}.

## Step 1: Install and run {{product_name}}

Follow the following steps below to download and install {{product_name}}. Refer to the [quick setup]({{base_path}}/get-started/quick-set-up/) to learn more.

1. Download the latest {{product_name}} version from the [website](https://wso2.com/identity-server/){: target="_blank"}.

2. Unzip the archive using the following command:

      ```sh
      unzip wso2is-<version>.zip
      # Replace <version> with your downloaded version, e.g., wso2is-7.1.0
      ```

3. Start the server:

    === "Linux/MacOS"

        ```sh
        cd path/to/wso2is-<version>/bin
        ./wso2server.sh
        ```

    === "Windows"

        ```sh
        cd path/to/wso2is-<version>/bin
        wso2server.bat
        ```

4. You can access the {{product_name}} Console by visiting the following URL and providing the default credentials of `admin`, `admin`.

      ```url
      https://localhost:9443
      ```

## Step 2: Create an OIDC application

To connect your mod_auth_openidc Apache HTTPD module to {{product_name}}, you need to register it as an application. To do so,

1. On the {{product_name}} Console, go to **Applications** > **New Application**.

      ![Add application step showing the Applications menu and Add Application option]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/protect-apps-with-identity-gateway/add-application-step.png)

## Step 4: Install Apache and mod_auth_openidc

Follow the steps below to install Apache httpd and the required dependencies.

!!! note

    The commands below assume a macOS environment. Use the corresponding package manager in your environment for installations. To learn more, refer to the [Apache httpd documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html){: target="_blank"}.

1. Install Apache httpd if you don't have it already.

    ```sh
    brew install httpd
    ```

2. Install the following dependencies required by mod_auth_openidc.

    ```sh
    brew install jansson cjose libcurl
    ```

3. Clone and build mod_auth_openidc.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc.git
    cd mod_auth_openidc
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-apxs=$(which apxs)
    make
    make install
    ```

    !!! tip "Troubleshoot build errors"

        Homebrew may install dependencies in non-standard locations, which can cause the installation to fail. 

        If the `./configure --with-apxs=$(which apxs)` command fails, try specifying the exact paths to the dependencies:

        ```sh
        ./configure --with-apxs2=/opt/homebrew/bin/apxs \
            --with-openssl=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3 \
            --with-jansson=/opt/homebrew/opt/jansson \
            --with-cjose=/opt/homebrew/opt/cjose
        make
        make install
        ```

        After building, the .so module should appear in `/opt/homebrew/lib/httpd/modules/mod_auth_openidc.so`.

## Step 5: Configure Apache to use mod_auth_openidc with {{product_name}}

The following steps explain how to configure mod_auth_openidc to act as a reverse proxy and authenticate users via WSO2 Identity Server.

1. Open your Apache configuration file at `/opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/httpd.conf` and add the following line to load the mod_auth_openidc module

    ```apache
    LoadModule auth_openidc_module /path/to/mod_auth_openidc.so
    ```

    !!! tip
        Load this module only once to avoid conflicts.

2. Create a new file at `/opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-oidc.conf` and add the following content. This file will contain the VirtualHost configuration for OIDC authentication.

    ```apache
    Listen 8002
    <VirtualHost *:8002>
        ServerName localhost

        OIDCCryptoPassphrase a-random-secret-value

        OIDCProviderMetadataURL https://localhost:9443/oauth2/oidcdiscovery/.well-known/openid-configuration

        OIDCClientID YOUR_CLIENT_ID
        OIDCClientSecret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
        OIDCRedirectURI http://localhost:8002/callback

        OIDCRemoteUserClaim sub
        OIDCSSLValidateServer Off

        ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

        <Location />
            AuthType openid-connect
            Require valid-user
        </Location>
    </VirtualHost>
    ```

    !!! note

        - Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the client ID and the client secret you received earlier when registering the application in {{product_name}}.

        - This sample configuration file assumes that the following services run on the specified ports. If your setup differs, adjust the configuration accordingly.
            - WSO2 Identity Server: `https://localhost:9443`
            - Apache with mod_auth_openidc: `http://localhost:8002`
            - Back-end Service (API or Web application): `http://localhost:8080`

3. Open the Apache configuration file at `/opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/httpd.conf` and include the following line to include the VirtualHost configuration file you created above.

    ```apache
    Include /opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/extra/httpd-oidc.conf
    ```

4. Start Apache.

    ```sh
    sudo apachectl restart
    ```

## Try it out

Now that youâ€™ve set up {{product_name}}, the sample application (or your own), and mod_auth_openidc Apache HTTPD module, follow the steps below to test them in action.

1. Log in to your app through the Apache server by visiting `http://localhost:8002`. You will be redirected to the login page of {{product_name}}.

2. Log in with an existing user.

3. After successfully logging in, the mod_auth_openidc module automatically injects OIDC claims into HTTP headers for your back-end application. You can access user information through headers like:

    - `OIDC_CLAIM_sub`: User identifier
    - `OIDC_CLAIM_org_name`: Organization name
    - `OIDC_access_token`: Access token
    - `OIDC_id_token`: ID token

    ![mod_auth_openidc logged in showing successful authentication and user information]({{base_path}}/assets/img/tutorials/protect-apps-with-identity-gateway/mod_auth_openidc_logged_in.png)

    !!! tip

        Include these configurations in your `httpd-oidc.conf` VirtualHost file to control which claims mod_auth_openidc forwards to the application.

        ```apache
        OIDCRemoteUserClaim sub
        OIDCClaimPrefix "OIDC_CLAIM_"
        OIDCClaimDelimiter "_"
        ```

        Learn more about these configurations in the [Apache documentation](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blob/master/auth_openidc.conf){: target="_blank"}.

## Advanced configurations

You can enhance the integration between {{product_name}} and mod_auth_openidc with the following advanced options.

### Encrypt connections with TLS

To encrypt communication between clients and mod_auth_openidc, you can enable TLS. To do so, add the following to your `httpd-oidc.conf` VirtualHost configuration file:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /path/to/cert.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/cert.key
    
    # ... rest of your OIDC configurations
</VirtualHost>
```

### Configure sessions handling

To manage user sessions for mod_auth_openidc, add the following directives to your `httpd-oidc.conf` VirtualHost configuration:

```apache
OIDCSessionInactivityTimeout 3600
OIDCSessionMaxDuration 86400
OIDCCookieHTTPOnly On
OIDCCookieSecure Off  # Set to On for production HTTPS
```

Learn more about these configurations in the [Apache documentation](https://github.com/OpenIDC/mod_auth_openidc/blob/master/auth_openidc.conf){: target="_blank"}.

---

Now that youâ€™ve successfully connected {{product_name}} with mod_auth_openidc module, you can leverage this integration to:

- Add authentication to applications that lack native OIDC support.

- Replace custom or insecure authentication methods.

- Centralize and simplify authentication logic.

This setup secures dashboards, microservices, and legacy apps, improving stack security, scalability, and maintainability.
