# Use {{product_name}} with identity gateways

An identity gateway sits in front of your application and enforces authentication and authorization before requests reach your application.

Identity gateways protect your application by,

- intercepting incoming traffic.

- verifying the userâ€™s identity (using protocols like OAuth2 or OpenID Connect).

- enforcing fine-grained access rules.

- forwarding the request to the application only if it meets the security requirements.

By connecting WSO2 Identity Server with identity gateways, you can centralize user management and apply consistent access control across your entire application ecosystem. This section explains how to connect {{product_name}} with the following identity gateways.

- [OAuth2 Proxy]({{base_path}}/references/tutorials/protect-apps-with-identity-gateway/protect-apps-with-oauth2proxy/)

- [Oathkeeper]({{base_path}}/references/tutorials/protect-apps-with-identity-gateway/protect-apps-with-oathkeeper/)
