# Flows

A flow defines the sequence a user follows during a specific interaction with your application. These can include forms, verification actions, conditional logic, and other components that guide users from start to finish.

{{product_name}} lets you build fully customizable sequences for the following user interactions.

- **Self-registration** - Create registration experiences for new users, with support for multi step forms, validations, and identity verification.

- **Password recovery** - Build secure recovery flows to help users regain access, using steps such as email verification or one time passwords (OTP).

You can build flows using starter templates, widgets, steps, and components, giving you complete control over how users interact with your application. To get started with building flows, refer to [Build a flow]({{base_path}}/guides/flows/build-a-flow/).

For specific examples of building flows, refer to [Self-registration]({{base_path}}/guides/flows/self-registration) and [Password recovery]({{base_path}}/guides/flows/password-recovery).
