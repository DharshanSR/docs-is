# Email and SMS template inheritance

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
You can customize email and sms templates to fit the branding needs of each organization. If you don't customize a template for an organization, it will inherit the design from the closest ancestor organization with a customized template. If no ancestor has customized the particular template, the default template will apply.
=======
In {{product_name}}, child organizations inherit email and SMS templates from their parent organizations. Child organizations can make their own adjustments to these inherited templates.

Organization administrators can access email and SMS templates from the {{product_name}} Console under **Branding** > **Email Templates** and **Branding** > **SMS Templates** respectively.

## How it works

Inheritance for email and SMS templates works as follows.

- Child organizations inherit email and SMS templates from the nearest ancestor with custom templates. If no ancestor has customized templates, the default templates apply.

- Organizations can customize their own email and SMS templates, overriding the inherited templates. These overridden templates then pass down to the organizationâ€™s descendants.

- Organizations can also revert their email and SMS templates, restoring the inherited values.
