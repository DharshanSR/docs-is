To test this scenario, attempt to update a user's password using both compromised and uncompromised passwords, verified
through [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords). The update can be performed via either the Console (
administrator action) or the My Account application (user self-service) to ensure that only uncompromised passwords are
accepted.

#### Console (administrator update)

1. Log in to the {{product_name}} Console application using an administrator account.
2. Navigate to **User Management** > **Users**.
3. Select a user and reset their password.

#### My Account (self-update)

1. Log in to the {{product_name}} My Account as a user.
2. Go to **Security** > **Change** Password.
3. Attempt to update the password.
